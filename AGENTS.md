# Agent Instructions

## Scope

- This repository is a standalone Home Assistant custom integration; the runtime entrypoint is `custom_components/hp_printers/__init__.py`.
- There is no runtime package manifest or lockfile; use the checked-in `.venv` for local verification.
- GitHub Actions are the canonical CI gate: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` mirrors the commands below on every push and pull request, and `hassfest` validates the manifest and brand assets.

## Verification

- Install test tooling with `./.venv/bin/uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements_test.txt` when needed.
- Run `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` for the unit suite.
- Run `./.venv/bin/ruff check --config ruff_ha.toml custom_components/hp_printers tests`.
- Run `./.venv/bin/ruff format --check --config ruff_ha.toml custom_components/hp_printers tests`.
- Run `./.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q custom_components/hp_printers tests` for a syntax-only check.
- Ruff is configured for Home Assistant conventions in `ruff_ha.toml`; do not substitute an ambient Ruff/Python version when the repository venv is available.
- The test stack is a single pin: `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component==0.13.356`, which transitively fixes `homeassistant==2026.8.2`, `pytest==9.0.3` and `pytest-asyncio==1.4.0`. Do not pin pytest or pytest-asyncio separately in `requirements_test.txt`; a separate pin conflicts with what this package requires and breaks CI while local runs stay green.
- The suite requires Python 3.14, which that package's Home Assistant pin also requires.
- `ruff_ha.toml` is extracted from Home Assistant core but **diverges deliberately in one place**: `known-first-party` is `["custom_components", "tests", "scripts"]`, not `["homeassistant"]`. Core builds the `homeassistant` package; here it is a dependency. Left as core had it, isort groups `custom_components` with third-party imports and CI fails on ordering. Re-apply this if the file is ever re-extracted.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs the same lint, format, test and JSON-parse checks against this venv. Install with `./.venv/bin/uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python pre-commit && ./.venv/bin/pre-commit install`. The hooks are `repo: local` on purpose: the upstream Ruff mirror pins its own Ruff version, which would disagree with the one CI uses.
- Lint and format **`scripts` as well as `custom_components/hp_printers` and `tests`** — CI does, and a check that omits a directory hides real errors in it.

## Test Policy

- **Any change that alters functionality must ship with tests.** A bug fix
  needs a regression test for the case it fixes; a new entity needs coverage
  of the parser path and the entity description that exposes it; a refactor
  must keep the existing suite green.
- The unit suite in `tests/` covers LEDM parsing in `api.py` and the
  config-flow normalization in `config_flow.py`. New behaviour should land
  in those modules (or a new sibling) and a matching test should appear
  alongside it.
- Do not delete a test to make a change pass. If a test is wrong, fix the
  test and explain why in the commit message.
- Coverage was 99% before the CDP and IPP clients landed. It is **97%**
  now, and `quality_scale.yaml` records that next to its `test-coverage`
  claim so the number is checkable rather than remembered. Measure with
  `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q --cov=custom_components/hp_printers
  --cov-report=term-missing`. Re-measure and update the claim in the same
  commit that moves the number: a stale `done` reads as a current
  guarantee, which is the failure mode to avoid.
  `api_cdp.py` is the module to watch -- it sat at 62% until the parsing
  helpers and the transport error paths were covered directly, and the
  gap was invisible until a coverage run rather than a review found it.
  `api_ipp.py` was the second one, at 90%, and covering it found a real
  bug: the parser skipped the four-octet value tag after an IPP extension
  tag instead of reading it, so every attribute behind one decoded as an
  unknown type and came back as raw bytes. The uncovered line was
  `index += 4` -- a line that looked obviously correct in isolation.

## Architecture

- `api.py` is a read-only LEDM client; it fetches XML from the printer's `/DevMgmt/*` endpoints and maps it into immutable dataclasses in `models.py`.
- `coordinator.py` polls dynamic data; the default interval is 60 seconds and the static product configuration is refreshed every six hours.
- `sensor.py` and `binary_sensor.py` contain the actual entity descriptions. Parsing a field in `api.py` or `models.py` does not expose it in Home Assistant until an entity description is added there.
- `config_flow.py` validates the printer before creating an entry, supports mDNS discovery via IPP/IPPS advertisements, and keys entries by printer serial number so DHCP address changes do not duplicate devices.
- `coordinator.py` backs off on consecutive failures: `backoff_interval()` is a pure function so it is testable without hass, and `_apply_backoff` is the only place `update_interval` is mutated. The configured interval is a floor -- backoff must never make polling faster than the user asked for.
- `coordinator.py` exposes `async_fetch_update` so the polling logic can be unit-tested without standing up a Home Assistant instance.
- `strings.json` supplies config-flow and entity names; update it when adding or renaming user-visible entities.
- `quality_scale.yaml` tracks which HA quality-scale rules the integration currently meets; update it when adding or removing coverage.

## Test Layers

The unit suite is built from plain Python doubles in `tests/fakes.py`
plus `MagicMock` for any HA layer we can't avoid, so most tests run in
milliseconds. Use the right layer for the change:

- **Parser behavior** (`tests/test_api.py`, `tests/test_api_parsing.py`,
  `tests/test_api_fixtures.py`): pure XML parsing, no event loop.
- **Models** (`tests/test_models.py`): dataclass invariants.
- **Entity layer** (`tests/test_entity_value_fns.py`): instantiate each
  description against a `FakeCoordinator` and assert
  `native_value` / `is_on` / `extra_state_attributes` matches the README.
- **Coordinator** (`tests/test_coordinator.py`): exercises
  `async_fetch_update` directly.
- **Diagnostics** (`tests/test_diagnostics.py`): the redaction pipeline.
- **Config flow, unit** (`tests/test_config_flow_probe.py`,
  `tests/test_config_flow.py`): the probe helper, reauth, and `_flatten`
  normalization, called directly.
- **Parser edge cases** (`tests/test_api_edge_cases.py`): malformed and
  absent values, and the HTTP boundary in `_fetch` with a fake session.
- **Bootstrap, through hass** (`tests/test_init.py`,
  `tests/test_config_flow_hass.py`): setup, unload, reload, and every flow
  step driven through Home Assistant's own managers. These use
  `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`, which blocks all sockets, so
  every network path must be mocked.
- **Real captures** (`tests/test_api_fixtures.py`): when
  `tests/fixtures/<host>/` is present, the fixture tests replay real XML.
  Tests skip gracefully when no fixture exists.

## Test fixtures and ordering

- `tests/__init__.py` exposes `setup_integration(hass, entry)` as a plain
  helper, called from the test body. It is deliberately **not** a fixture:
  as a fixture it is ordered against the mocks by the test signature, and a
  test listing it before the client patch runs setup against the real client
  and trips the socket block. This mirrors
  `homeassistant/tests/components/brother`.
- Patch `LEDMClient` in **both** binding namespaces:
  `custom_components.hp_printers.LEDMClient` and
  `custom_components.hp_printers.config_flow.LEDMClient`.
- Any test loading the integration through hass needs
  `enable_custom_integrations`.
- The mocked client must supply a real string for `base_url`; it reaches
  `DeviceInfo(configuration_url=...)`, which rejects a `MagicMock`.
- Unloading an entry does **not** remove its states. The entity registry
  writes an `unavailable` state for each registered entity instead, so
  assert on `STATE_UNAVAILABLE` rather than on absence.

- A real capture from an HP Color LaserJet MFP M182nw lives in
  `tests/fixtures/m182nw/`. `tests/test_api_fixtures.py` pins its known
  values, which is also the record of what that model does **not** report:
  no `ProductInformation/Manufacturer`, no refill counters, no ADF or
  duplex counters, and an `Installation/Date` of `1976-01-01` because the
  device has no real-time clock.
- `scripts/captures/` is git-ignored: raw captures contain the real serial
  number. Only the reviewed, anonymized copy under `tests/fixtures/`
  belongs in the repository.

## Capturing fixtures from a real printer

Real LEDM payloads are the highest-value test input because they capture
quirks no XML hand-rolled in a test file will reproduce. To add a
fixture:

1. Run `./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_ledm.py --host <printer-host>`
   from a machine on the same network. The script writes raw XML into
   `scripts/captures/<host>-<timestamp>/`.
2. Run `./.venv/bin/python scripts/anonymize_ledm.py scripts/captures/<dir>/`.
   The anonymizer replaces `SerialNumber`, `UUID`, `ServiceID`, hostnames,
   IPs, and cartridge serial numbers with stable dummies and swaps
   `ProductNumber` for the captured `MakeAndModel`. Review the diff.
3. Copy the `<dir>-anon` directory into `tests/fixtures/<short-name>/`
   and commit. The fixture tests will pick it up automatically.
4. The capture is read-only -- every request is a `GET`.

**Adding an endpoint to `capture_ledm.py` means auditing it for identity
fields.** Walk the new document, add every identifier tag to
`IDENTIFIER_TAGS` in `anonymize_ledm.py`, and add a case to
`tests/test_anonymize.py` asserting the raw value does not survive. The
anonymizer is a filter over tag names we have seen; it cannot infer a
field it has never met. `IOConfigDyn` needed four spellings of the
hostname plus the MAC in two places.

Two rules the anonymizer has already been bitten by:

- `main()` must not reimplement the pipeline. It calls `anonymize_file`,
  which is the only place the pipeline exists -- a second copy silently
  reverted a fix once already.
- A tag replaced by `IDENTIFIER_TAGS` is not then run through the
  free-text patterns, or the placeholder gets rewritten again (a netmask
  became an IP address that way).

## Device/API Traps

- The integration never writes to the printer. Preserve read-only `GET` behavior.
- HP LEDM is self-describing but undocumented; only create entities for values the device actually reports, otherwise the setup omits them.
- Printer HTTPS commonly uses a self-signed certificate and legacy static-RSA ciphers; use the existing `printer_ssl_context()` path rather than replacing it with default TLS settings.
- The zeroconf-announced IPP port is not the LEDM web-server port; discovery deliberately uses the printer hostname with the configured HTTP/HTTPS web port.
- Product and consumable fields can contain sentinel or historical values. Preserve the filtering and naming semantics in `api.py` and `models.py`, especially `PreviousCartridgeData`, which describes the cartridge removed from a slot rather than the installed cartridge.
- `IOConfigDyn` is fetched through `_fetch_optional`, which swallows failures: not every model serves it, and a missing optional resource must not fail the whole update. Its `NetworkStatus` cannot report an outage -- the document is read over the adaptor it describes -- so it is never wired into availability; the error counters are the part worth having.
- The network port type must be read from the `IOAdaptorConfig` that actually contains `NetworkAdaptorConfig`. The first one in the document is USB on every capture seen so far.
- No network identity (hostname, IP, MAC) is parsed at all. The anonymizer scrubs those from fixtures, and nothing should start reading them into entities or diagnostics.
- Diagnostics are intentionally redacted in `diagnostics.py`; do not expose host, serial, UUID, or user identifiers in new diagnostic output.

## Releases

- **Versioning is Home Assistant's own: `YEAR.MONTH.RELEASE`** -- `2026.8.0`, `2026.8.1`, then `2026.9.0` when the month turns over. The month is not zero-padded and `RELEASE` counts from 0 within each month. `tests/test_manifest.py` pins the format.
- **Releases are automatic.** `.github/workflows/release.yaml` runs after CI succeeds on `main`, computes the next calendar version, writes it into `manifest.json`, commits, tags and publishes. Nothing to bump by hand.
- Release notes are built from commit subjects, not GitHub's `--generate-notes`, which lists merged pull requests and therefore lists nothing here. **Commit subjects are the changelog** -- write them for someone reading the release page.
- A release is cut only when something under `custom_components/` changed since the last release. Documentation, CI and test-only commits ship nothing to a user and get no version.
- The release commit carries `[skip ci]`, which is what stops it triggering CI and looping back into this workflow. Do not remove it.
- The next version is computed from **both** existing releases and existing tags, and the job fails if the computed tag already exists. Deleting a release leaves its tag behind, and reusing that number would silently attach the new release to the old tag's commit.
- Releases are cut from the exact commit CI passed on, not from whatever `main` points at when the job runs.
- HACS reads **published** releases. A draft or a bare tag is invisible to it, and a draft that was never tagged only appears on the repository's Releases page, not at any tag URL.
- release-drafter was removed: it categorises merged pull requests, and this repository commits directly to `main`, so it produced empty drafts. If the workflow ever moves to PRs, it is worth restoring.
- Versions before `2026.8.0` used semver (`v0.1.0`). The calendar scheme sorts above them, so the switch needed no special handling.
